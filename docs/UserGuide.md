# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 About Green Mileage Efforts
Green Mileage Efforts(GME) is an efficient carpooling management solution designed to help corporations reduce their carbon footprint. The GME system allows for the simple creation and management of weekly carpooling groups of employees looking to carpool to and from their office. These [pools](#6-glossary) of employees can then carpool from the office regularly on the specified days and times every week. Through the GME system, users can find employees based on their carpooling preferences and quickly group them with drivers. The system also maintains a database of the arranged carpooling groups for easy management.

GME is a platform that follows a [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#6-glossary) such that power users that are familiar can efficiently navigate the program.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tag/finance` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/finance`, `tag/finance tag/management` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
