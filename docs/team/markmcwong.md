## Project: Green Mileage Efforts

Green Mileage Efforts (GME) is an efficient carpooling management solution designed to help corporations reduce their 
carbon footprint. The GME system allows for the simple creation and management of weekly carpooling groups of employees 
looking to carpool to and from their office. These pools of employees can then carpool from the office 
regularly on the specified days and times every week.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the findPool command feature. (Pull requests [\#126](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/126), [\#216](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/216))
  * What it does: allows the user to find the pools in the GME system by the names of passengers in the pool.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily find the pools they desired to join, leave or see the details in combination with other commands.
  
* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)
