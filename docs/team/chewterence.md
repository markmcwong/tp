## Project: Green Mileage Efforts

Green Mileage Efforts (GME) is an efficient carpooling management solution designed to help corporations reduce their 
carbon footprint. The GME system allows for the simple creation and management of weekly carpooling groups of employees 
looking to carpool to and from their office. These pools of employees can then carpool from the office 
regularly on the specified days and times every week.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Pool command feature. (Pull requests [\#121](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/121))
  * What it does: Allows the user to create a pool from the list of passengers, and add it to the list of pools in the GME system.
  * Justification: This feature is the core feature of the product, where pools are created and added to the pool list by the user.

* **New Feature**: Added Unpool command feature. (Pull requests [\#101](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/101), 
  [\#121](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/121))
  * What it does: Allows the user to remove a pool from the existing list of pools.
  * Justification: This feature complements the core feature of the product, as pools within the pool list could either 
    already be completed or entered with wrong details.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=chewterence&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)
